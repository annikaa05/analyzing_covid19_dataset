# analyzing_covid19_dataset

With the emergence of a new pandemic worldwide, a novel strategy approach has emerged. 
Here, we are utilizing R and statistics to analyze worldwide datasets from resources publicly available. 

# Statistical Model

Null hypothesis:  Null hypothesis is the hypothesis which is tested for possible rejection under the assumption that it is true . Null hypothesis is denoted by H0

Alternative hypothesis:  Any hypothesis which is complementary to null hypothesis is called alternative hypothesis and is denoted by H1 .

Two tailed hypothesis:  A test with the null hypothesis H0 : θ = θ0 against hypothesis H1 : θ ≠ θ0 , is two tailed test.

Confidence level:   The maximum probability of making type-I error is called level of significance and is denoted by
where 𝞪 = P (making Type-I error)
              = P (H0 is rejected when it is true)
This can be measured in terms of percentage i.e. 5%, 1%, 10% etc.

Test statistic:   Compare the test statistic value with the tabulated value at 𝞪 % l.o.s. and make a decision whether to accept or to reject the null hypothesis.
If Calculated |t| > tabulated |t| that is null hypothesis is rejected.
Else if Calculated |t| < tabulated |t| that is null hypothesis is accepted.
